what is javascript and why we used it ? 

- javascrpt is logic based programming language where we can create our code project functionality in that.
- javascrpt is a high level programming language for build web pages.
- Now we used the ES6(echma script 6) version of javascript, in other words we called vanila javascript. 
- runtime environment of javascript is node js.

variable :- 

- varible is container to store some data. 
- in javascript we have 3 types of variables
1. let :-
    - Let is a type of variable which is used for changing the varibale name later.
    - Now these days , most of the cases we used let for creating varibale.
    - Let is a block scope code so we have been using let for most of the cases.
2. var :-
    - Var is a type of variable which is also used for changing the variable later stage.
    - Var is used in oldest browser so now a days we are dont use var most of the time.
3. const :- 
    - const is a type of varible where we can't change our data further.
    - const means constant to store some data like numbers, integer etc..


task :- 
1. difference between let & var. 
2. Difference between var & const. 
3. what do you mean by haisting. (when we dont declare value of varibale but it execute the code)
